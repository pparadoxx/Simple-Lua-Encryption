# What is this?

Simple Lua Encryption (SLE) is an encryption method written for Garry's Mod.

# Usage
The only functions you'll need to call to utilize this script is sle.Encrypt(str,key) & sle.Decrypt(str,key). The arguments are also very simple, str is the text you want to encrypt & key is the key you want to use (needs to be longer text then the string).
